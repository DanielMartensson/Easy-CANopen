# Easy CANopen

This library use the protocol `CANopen`. It's a protocol made for industrial automation and it's told to be very complex. That's why I created
this repository because I want `CANopen` to be easy to use.


Do you want to help to build up an easy CANopen library that only focus on to make it very simple to use CANopen?
